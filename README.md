[[English](./README.md)] [[简体中文](./README_CN.md)]

Some basic algorithms in TS

## Purpose

- The basic algorithm should be in the [js-demo](https://github.com/ginlink/js-demo) project, but not often reviewed, so the algorithm is easy to forget, so a new special project, I hope the algorithm will not fall behind.
- Enhance logical ability and keep thinking active every day.
- To lay a good foundation for writing engineering code, algorithm is a programmer's internal skill.
